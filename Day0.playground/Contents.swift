Objective:

In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. You will need to use
the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank. Check out the
Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task:

To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print "Hello, World." on a
single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.
You've got this!

Note: The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch
languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, and the input String variable may be written
differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

Input Format:
A single line of text denoting inputString (the variable whose contents must be printed).

Output Format:
Print Hello, World. on the first line, and the contents of input.String on the second line.

"""

let inputString = readLine()! // get a line of input from stdin and save it to our variable

// Your first line of output goes here
print("Hello, World.")

// Write the second line of output

print(inputString)
